# Stella sora build
A simple web application that allows users to view recommended builds for characters from the game Stella Sora and put them together in teams. This will allow the user to preview recommended cards during ascension. 

The latest working build of the application should be available at: https://stella-sora-build.pages.dev/

If you have any suggestions for builds, feel free to post them in Issues, but keep in mind that this is a simple application that allows you to freely combine characters. This means that support characters are not tailored to specific niche vanguard builds. I don't want to clutter it up by adding 20 of the same characters in different configurations.
